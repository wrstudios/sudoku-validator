# Sudoku Validator

Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Write a command-line program that can read a file containing a Sudoku grid and validate it. The grid can be partially or completely solved. Return either a success message or an error message.

## Setup Instructions

- `fork the github repo`
- run `bin/setup`

Fork the GitHub repo into your own account and do all your work on a feature branch named `{initials}-solution`.  Once you are done with your solution and all the tests are passing, submit a pull request on **YOUR** forked copy for review and email us the link to your PR.

# IMPORTANT 
**DO NOT** submit a PR to our repository - We would like to keep all solution submissions separate and not in the public view.
Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) if you are unsure of the process.

## Exercise Details:
A Sudoku is valid if:

- It has no duplicates in a row
- It has no duplicates in a column
- It has no duplicates in a sub-group (the nine smaller 3x3 grids).

## Input Files

The input files look like this

```
8 5 0 |0 0 2 |4 0 0 
7 2 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 9 
0 0 4 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
------+------+------
0 0 0 |1 0 7 |0 0 2 
3 0 5 |0 0 0 |9 0 0 
0 4 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
------+------+------
0 0 0 |0 8 0 |0 7 0 
0 1 7 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
0 0 0 |0 3 6 |0 4 0 
```

**Important:** zeros represent squares which do not have a value assigned yet. Having multiple zeroes in a row, column, or subgroup does not make the puzzle invalid.

### HOW TO KNOW YOU'RE DONE

This exercise provides a set of high-level integration tests that will pass when you're done. 
You will very likely want (*AND ENCOURAGED*) to write additional unit tests to test-drive your classes.
